    "# Introduction to Coordinates and Time\n",
    "The concept of coordinates and time is hopefully not alien (get it?) to you; however, astronomy being the precise field that it is, there are several time and coordinate systems in use, with slight variations between them, which may be important depending on your type of study (if you are studying the timing of the pulses of a pulsar for example, vs. the proper motion of stars in the sky)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we approach the end of the planned series of tutorials, we once again state our main goal: to make you self-sufficient in using Python. Keeping that in mind, we have put in significantly less material than previous tutorials, since we expect you to keep referring to the AstroPy documentation. (also note, AstroPy has several functions and classes, which reflect the many uses that astronomers find for different quantities. So it is practically impossible to cover all of that in one tutorial). So this will only get you started in your AstroPy quest; find out more about the equations and coordinate and time systems used here, and their implementations in AstroPy.!"

Due to its large size, see below, a modified version called Modified Julian Days (yes, very creative) is used where the reference is Midnight Nov 17, 1858. Because MJD is defined from midnight, the integer part changes at noon (in UTC, see below for scales), which makes it convenient for astronomers.  \n"
